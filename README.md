# what is it?

mriya is a scrolling x11 window-manager inspired by niri, i3wm and plan9's rio. 

# why use this?

- simple codebase
- you can actually take screenshots, unlike wayland compositors.
- it would make me really happy

# fun fact

- mriya was named after the an225 mriya, the largest aircraft ever that was destroyed during the russo-ukranian war.

- mriya means dream in ukranian.
